decisions we've made but should consider: remove emoticons, leave hashtags but remove hash symbol, remove stopwords
tasks: find a baseline semantic network, tie weight distribution, cliques, component distribution, k-cores

Jim will start processing the entire corpus of tweets. For now we will work with the 1 million tweet sample, /var/analytics/ on boston SoME lab server.



TASKS:

1. Basic analytics (Kyle)

- tie weight distribtuion
- network size as a function of pruning size
- top/bottomquantiles of  word pairs
- average word length 
- average tweets length
- etc.


2. Subgroup identification (Logan)

- k-cores
- cliques
- etc.

3. Components (Jim)

- How does the component size distribution change with pruning level?
- Do components match our rumors?


Anu and John will also help out. In particular we can explore these same three features for the baseline data - Brown Corpus and the Twitter Sentiment.
